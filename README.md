# Brain Tumor Classification and Detection | Machine Learning
# Problem Definition
The proposed system scans the Magnetic Resonance images of brain. The scanning is followed by preprocessing which enhances the input image and applies filter to it. After enhancement, the image undergoes segmentation and feature extractions. Based on the feature extraction the system identifies whether the tumor is cancerous or non - cancerous (benign).
# Flow of the project
1.MRI Image Input

2.Processing of Image: Usage of Filters and Noise removal

3.Image Segmentation

4.Feature Extraction

5.Classification of the Tumor
