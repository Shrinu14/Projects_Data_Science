# Brain Tumor Classification and Detection | Machine Learning
Building a detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras.
Used a brain MRI images data founded on Kaggle.[You can find link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)

About the data:
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains 253 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

# Problem Definition
The proposed system scans the Magnetic Resonance images of brain. The scanning is followed by preprocessing which enhances the input image and applies filter to it. After enhancement, the image undergoes segmentation and feature extractions. Based on the feature extraction the system identifies whether the tumor is cancerous or non - cancerous (benign).
